3D Helix Jump style arcade game built in Unity using C# with modular gameplay scripts and physics-based mechanics.
Helix Jump Game – Unity (C#)

A 3D arcade Helix Jump inspired game developed using Unity and C# programming.
Developed as a part of the Gravitas technical event.

🎮 Gameplay Description

The gameplay involves moving the player continuously forward while passing through a tunnel structure that rotates.
The gravity inversion feature is available using the spacebar to overcome obstacles and move ahead.

The score will increase depending on the distance covered.

⚙️ Key Features

--> Modular script design
--> Player movement using Rigidbody physics
--> Gravity inversion feature
--> Collision detection and game restart system
--> Camera follow system
--> Distance-based scoring system

🧠 Technical Details

The scripts used are:

--> PlayerMovement.cs – Handles player movement, gravity inversion, and scoring
--> CollisionHandler.cs – Handles collision detection and game restart functionality
--> TunnelMovement.cs – Manages tunnel rotation based on player input
--> FollowPlayer.cs – Implements camera follow functionality

🛠 Technologies Used

--> Unity Engine
--> C#
--> Rigidbody physics system
--> Unity Scene Management

🚀 Controls

--> Right Arrow → Rotate tunnel to the right
--> Left Arrow → Rotate tunnel to the left
--> Spacebar → Invert gravity

📌 Key Points

This project was initially developed during a guided workshop and later refined to improve modular design and understanding of Unity’s physics and scripting systems.
